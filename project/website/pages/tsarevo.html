                    The Church of the Assumption stands alone on the southern peninsula of the city. It is located in the Vasiliko district, where the town of Tsarevo originally originated. After a large-scale fire in 1882, it was moved to the side, but after a while the old town was restored and today it is a district of Tsarevo.                </p>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">
                 The church has three naves, with two rows of five columns separating the middle nave from the side naves. A light wooden partition separates the porch from the nave, and the altar space, which is large and has an apse, is separated from the nave by a high carved iconostasis. Both the iconostasis and the pulpit have certain Greek influences. The church has thin stone walls, varied with rows of bricks. The covering is wooden and the ceilings are lined with boards. Above the middle nave, the ceiling mimics a massive vault. The floor is covered with marble tiles. There are no murals.                </p>

                    At the same place there was an older church called the Holy Trinity. Some icons from the last decades of the 18th century are reminiscent of it. They are from the hand of the painter John of Ahtopol. The format of these icons is smaller and their adaptation to a new iconostasis indicates the existence of an older one. Picturesque corrections were made on them by the painter G. Polyxoidou.                </p>
