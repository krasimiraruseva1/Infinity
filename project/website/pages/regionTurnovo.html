                <h2>Malko Turnovo</h2>
                <p> Malko Tarnovo is located 76 km south of Bourgas, 56 km southwest of Tsarevo and 7 km from the border with the Republic of Turkey. It is located in the heart of the Bulgarian Strandzha, in a valley surrounded by high hills between the rivers
                    Rezovska and Mechi dol. The surroundings of the city offer a wide choice of interesting places for recreation in nature - preserved wooded areas with numerous springs, chapels, over 60 centuries old trees. Only 5 km southwest is the
                    highest point in the Bulgarian Strandzha - Golyamo Gradishte peak (710 m), from where there is a spacious view of the hills of Strandzha, and in clear weather you can see the Black Sea.</p>

                <h2>The big scream</h2>
                <p> The name of the town is also connected with the Great Heath - according to some local historians it originates from "thorn" (Trunovo - Tarnovo) because of the thick thorns, among which were hidden the sacred spring and its guardians -
                    the fairies. According to others, it comes from Terra nova (terra/land/- nova/water) - Terranova - Ternova - Tarnovo - "land by the water". In fact, the two hypotheses are close and seem to complement each other. The green heart of
                    Strandzha - Malko Tarnovo - is pounding, and it can't be otherwise, because it draws energy from the magical power of its spring - the Great Heath.

                    of the servants of the temple), a mound necropolis, an ancient aqueduct, a mine and the ruins of a fortress located on the very top. The cult building was also the tomb of a Thracian tribal chief priest and hero. In the V-III century
                    BC.

                <h2>Thracian necropolis and tombs in the area of Propada</h2>
                <p> It is located 3 km northwest of Malko Tarnovo, on the slope of a low hill with about 40 burial mounds. It is a complex of tombs from different eras and architectural solutions: a dome tomb from the IV - III century BC, a tomb with a base
                    carved into natural rock, a gabled tomb and cyst graves (burial chambers built of large stone slabs). They all follow an old building tradition and illustrate the transition from a dolmen to a tomb.
