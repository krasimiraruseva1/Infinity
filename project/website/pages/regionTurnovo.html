                        of the servants of the temple), a mound necropolis, an ancient aqueduct, a mine and the ruins of a fortress located on the very top. The cult building was also the tomb of a Thracian tribal chief priest and hero. In the V-III century BC.</p>

                    <h2>The big scream</h2>
                    <p>The name of the town is also connected with the Great Heath - according to some local historians it originates from "thorn" (Trunovo - Tarnovo) because of the thick thorns, among which were hidden the sacred spring and its guardians - the
                        fairies. According to others, it comes from Terra nova (terra/land/- nova/water) - Terranova - Ternova - Tarnovo - "land by the water". In fact, the two hypotheses are close and seem to complement each other. The green heart of Strandzha
                        - Malko Tarnovo - is pounding, and it can't be otherwise, because it draws energy from the magical power of its spring - the Great Heath.</p>
