                    <p>About 2 km from the center of Tsarevo, at the end of the southern peninsula, you will find the old church "Assumption". You can not miss it, as it can be clearly seen from the shores of Tsarevo.

                        It was built in 1831 on the foundations of another church, called the Holy Trinity, and is believed to have existed before the 16th century. The church suffered a huge fire and had to be restored in 1895 to the condition we see it today.</p>

                    <h2>Church of Tsar Boris Mihail</h2>
                    <p>This church was built in 1936 and was named after the baptizer of the Bulgarians Tsar Boris Michael. It is located in the heart of Tsarevo, just behind the central square.

                        It is believed that during its construction there was not enough money to complete it. During one of his visas, the then ruler, Tsar Boris III, decided to donate money to complete the construction of the church after hearing about the problem of the locals.</p>
