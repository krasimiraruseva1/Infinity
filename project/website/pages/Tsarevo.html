                            <p> The cave itself is located very close to Rezovska river. It has sunk into a deep ravine, and a small river descends over its entrance, which disappears into its bowels. The Maharata is an ancient Thracian sanctuary of the mother goddess. It is built of many underground galleries. Today, however, they are covered with stones and can only be reached by the main gallery of the cave. It is said that the tunnels reach as far as the Rezovska River, but this cannot be proven. It is possible that in the past the ancient Thracians even mined ore here.</p>

                <p>According to the local legend about the origin of the name of the village in antiquity, the place of today's Varvara was inhabited by Thracian tribes, which are engaged in special agriculture and animal husbandry. They often attacked the neighboring city of Agatopolis (today's Ahtopol). It was inhabited by Greeks, who began to call them barbarians, and hence the name of their village - Barbara.</p>
