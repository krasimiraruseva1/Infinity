                            <p> The Petrova Niva area is an object of national importance - in 1970 it was declared a historical cultural monument. It is located 32 km from Malko Tarnovo and 67 km from Bourgas. In 1903, a congress of the VII Edirne Revolutionary District was held here, at which the Internal Macedonian-Edirne Revolutionary Organization decided to declare the Transfiguration Uprising in support of the Ilinden Uprising that broke out in Macedonia.</p>

                            <p>The name of the town is also connected with the Great Heath - according to some local historians it originates from "thorn" (Trunovo - Tarnovo) because of the thick thorns, among which were hidden the sacred spring and its guardians - the
                                fairies. According to others, it comes from Terra nova (terra/land/- nova/water) - Terranova - Ternova - Tarnovo - "land by the water". In fact, the two hypotheses are close and seem to complement each other. The green heart of Strandzha
                                - Malko Tarnovo - is pounding, and it can't be otherwise, because it draws energy from the magical power of its spring - the Great Heath.</p>
