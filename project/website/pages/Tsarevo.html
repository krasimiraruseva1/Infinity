                            <p> The cave itself is located very close to Rezovska river. It has sunk into a deep ravine, and a small river descends over its entrance, which disappears into its bowels. The Maharata is an ancient Thracian sanctuary of the mother goddess. It is built of many underground galleries. Today, however, they are covered with stones and can only be reached by the main gallery of the cave. It is said that the tunnels reach as far as the Rezovska River, but this cannot be proven. It is possible that in the past the ancient Thracians even mined ore here.</p>
