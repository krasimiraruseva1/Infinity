                <h2> Legend</h2>
                  <p>When God decided to create Strandzha, he smiled. And from this divine smile she was born,” say the people living in the most beautiful and mysterious mountain, stretched out on the territory of two countries - Bulgaria and Turkey.
                    Several Thracian civilizations flourished on its territory during different periods. The most significant of them is the Odrysko-Sapi dynasty, which created the Odrysian kingdom with its capital Bison (presumably today’s Urdoviza). It was during this period that the foundations of that typical Strandzha spiritual culture were laid, whose Thracian roots we find to this day. That is why the mountain is full of discovered and still undiscovered Thracian sanctuaries, dolmens and facilities, some of which date back to … Atlantic times! It was in Strandzha that the bones of giants were found, which were immediately covered up. And this is proof that most of the Atlanteans who survived the cataclysm, who spread their culture among the local Thracian population, probably took refuge here in antiquity. In general, Strandzha Mountain is rich in mysteries.
                    Here legends intertwine with facts, and science with mysticism. Undoubtedly the biggest mystery, however, remains the so-called Bastet’s tomb. In the late 80s of the twentieth century there was a legend that at the foot of Gradishte, the highest peak of the mountain, was buried the Egyptian goddess with a cat’s head. It is said that her sanctuary is a portal to another dimension in space. There is an Egyptian pyramid built around the tenth century BC. and covered with tons of earth and pieces of rock to hide. The version was taken up by the military, who stumbled on the mysteries in the hole of the Queen for years.
